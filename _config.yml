  I am a Master student at Department of Future Convergence Technology in Soonchunhyang Univ. and advised by [Byeongjoon Noh](https://sites.google.com/view/bj-noh). 

  My research interests lie in <mark>Computer Vision</mark>, <mark>Federated Learning</mark>, and <mark>Action Recognition</mark>.

  Recently, I have been interested in applying <mark>large language model (LLM)</mark> and <mark>multi-modal large language models (MLLM)</mark> to <mark>autonomous driving</mark> and <mark>intelligent transportation systems</mark>.

  My research primarily focuses on applying deep learning and machine learning to improve traffic safety and predict pedestrian risk through computer vision technology.
#Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>like this</mark>.
#
#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started#what-is-markdown) supports such as
#    - Lists
#    - Tables
#    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
